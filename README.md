### Hi, I am Mantej SinghðŸ‘‹
I am a Python developer, the main reason I like coding in Python is its syntax, its easy to read and helps me to code in few steps (most of the time in one line)
Other than coding, I spend my time listening to music, working out, movies on weekends, and cooking. On Sundays, I spend my time volunteering at my local <a href="https://letsshareameal.org/">Sikh temple</a>.

:heavy_check_mark:Iâ€™m currently working with great minds:star2: from Verizon Wireless(Team Gizmo Land), where my python code analyzes the data from logs and plots the lat/long on a map. As simple as that.
